To use Chunity, you will need to move these folders into the top level
of your Assets folder:
- Streaming Assets

The reason for this is that Unity mandates that there is only one of each
of these kinds of special folders, and that they must reside at the top
level of your Assets folder. If your project already has this folder,
then you will need to copy the contents of Chunity/Streaming Assets/ 
into your project's existing folder of the same name.

Additionally, you should not change the names of these directories since
they are also special folders:
- Plugins
- Editor
- Resources
